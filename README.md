# MKR1000
Arduino MKR1000 Web code
This is a work in progress. When finished, it will start as a web server and prompt with a variety of fields including WiFi access credentials, then it will switch to a WiFi client and connect to an AP.

At the moment it is just a test program. Soon it will become a set of functions. When it is proven to work, it will become a library. 

Issues at the moment are:
Radio button wrapper does not return a value.

Dropdown and text work well, and fields and text are reasonably formatted, but could use some spiffy CSS.

A function only version will be added as a separate program and this will remain for testing and improvements.
